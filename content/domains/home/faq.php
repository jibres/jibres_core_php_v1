echo T_("Think of your domain name as a street address. If people search for your domain, they'll be able to find your website. Every website on the internet has a unique IP address assigned to it, made up of a series of numbers. These numbers tell the domain name system (DNS) to locate the corresponding website. As we are humans and not computers, IP addresses are difficult to remember and so words are used instead. These words are known as the domain or URL. The DNS looks at the domain name and translates it into an IP address.");

Yes, .com domain extensions are popular, but due to their popularity, you may find that your dream domain has already been taken.

The web is changing all the time, and as the web grows, so will the familiarity of new TLDs.");

Additionally, companies value short domains that match their company name or products, meaning these domains are typically the most desirable.
