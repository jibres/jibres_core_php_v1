echo T_("Think of your domain name as a street address. If people search for your domain, they'll be able to find your website. Every website on the internet has a unique IP address assigned to it, made up of a series of numbers. These numbers tell the domain name system (DNS) to locate the corresponding website. As we are humans and not computers, IP addresses are difficult to remember and so words are used instead. These words are known as the domain or URL. The DNS looks at the domain name and translates it into an IP address.");

echo T_("Top-level domains were introduced to help organize the locations in the domain name system. All domains include a top-level domain (TLD) and a second-level domain (SLD). Imagine you own a business in the USA. In 'yourbusiness.us', the TLD is .us and the SLD is 'yourbusiness'.");

echo T_("When it comes to picking a top-level domain for your website, there are plenty of options. Yes, .com domain extensions are popular, but due to their popularity, you may find that your dream domain has already been taken. Why not consider choosing a generic (gTLD) like .club for your tennis club, or a country-code (ccTLDs) like .co.uk for your UK office?");

     <p><?php
echo T_("If you're a new business it may be important to choose a familiar domain extension like .com, a localized domain or a well-known gTLD. As they are popular, they are perceived as more trustworthy. Don't panic if you haven't managed to get one. The web is changing all the time, and as the web grows, so will the familiarity of new TLDs.");

     <p><?php
echo T_("As premium domains include common words they are often the most memorable. Additionally, companies value short domains that match their company name or products, meaning these domains are typically the most desirable.
