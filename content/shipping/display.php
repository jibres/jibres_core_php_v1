For any ecommerce business, it's important to create a seamless shipping experience to guarantee customer satisfaction."); ?></p>
 	<p><?php echo T_("There's a lot happening behind the scenes of ecommerce shipping. You may be trying to decide which carrier to use and wondering how to determine ecommerce shipping costs that will satisfy both you and your customers."); ?> <span class="txtB"><?php echo T_("We're here to help."); ?></span></p>
 	<p><?php echo T_("When determining how to ship products from your ecommerce store, there are a few considerations. Will you use the postal service, a shipping carrier or local courier? Your shipping method will vary depending on what is being shipped, or where it is being sent.") ?></p>

 	<h3 class="txtB"><?php echo T_("Come up with a shipping strategy") ?></h3>
 	<p><?php echo T_("It's important to strategize your online shipping method by examining the options and picking the best one to fit your needs. Without a strategy, e-commerce shipping can be a time-consuming hassle - you may even lose money. Important aspects of your ecommerce shipping strategy include delivery method (carrier), available countries, tracking and packaging. If you decide to offer free shipping, or ship bulk orders, your strategy becomes even more critical.") ?></p>
 	<p><?php echo T_("Ultimately, you want to streamline your shipping process so it's something that you do without thinking - your shipping method, rate calculation, packaging and labeling process should become routine and easy. Do your research about shipping costs to find a reliable method and test your ecommerce shipping calculator before launching your store, so you cut down on 'trial and error' experiences with your first customers.") ?></p>
	<p><?php echo T_("Jibres offers a variety of easy-to-use shipping settings, like free shipping, fixed or flat rates and custom shipping calculators. It also provides real-time integration with carrier and postal services, so you can configure your Jibres store to automatically calculate ecommerce shipping rates from carriers.") ?> <?php echo T_("You can easily adjust your carrier-calculated rate settings to account for package dimensions, or handling expenses, like packaging or insurance.") ?></p>

 	<p><?php echo T_("The easiest way to determine the most accurate and lowest ecommerce shipping rate is to use a carrier's automatic calculator. But what if you want to set a flat rate? In this case, it's best to restrict your shipping to specific destinations. Do some math, and figure out the average cost.") ?></p>
 	<p><?php echo T_("If your products are valuable or fragile, consider including insurance in your shipping costs. The rate may go up, but you and your customer's peace of mind will pay off.") ?></p>
 	<p><?php echo T_("There are a lot of variables in ecommerce shipping costs: destination, speed, weight, dimensions of the box, fuel surcharges and discounts. No matter how much planning you do with your first shipments the cost will probably not be a perfect match to what you expected or charged the customer. Be prepared to scrutinize the first 25-50 shipments and adjust your pricing accordingly.") ?></p>

 	<h3 class="txtB"><?php echo T_("Offer free shipping") ?></h3>
 	<p><?php echo T_("Free shipping is a huge conversion rate improvement - even though you know that shipping isn't free to you the merchant. Free shipping removes a major psychological barrier to a consumer buying online rather than at a store and many studies have shown that it will increase sales since many consumers will refuse to pay for it. If you want to offer free shipping, make sure you are reasonably able to absorb the costs. The prices of your products need to cover shipping costs, including packaging and labor.") ?></p>
 	<p><?php echo T_("Customers may often abandon their shopping carts because of the extra shipping costs. By offering free shipping options at checkout you can encourage your customers to complete their orders.") ?></p>
 	<p><?php echo T_("There is a lot take into account when considering this option, but free shipping is popular with customers. It's a good idea to restrict free shipping to a basket size that you know you can cover your costs - say $50 or $100. Even Amazon has a $49 minimum for free shipping so customers do expect that they must spend something to get the benefit. With Jibres you can set up free shipping with a minimum threshold.") ?></p>

	 	<p><?php echo T_("Remember, your packing style not only affects the safety of the items you ship, but also customer perceptions about your store. Instead of wasting material securing products so they don't get damaged in big boxes, purchase envelopes and boxes in variety packs with different size options. This will also help you avoid dreaded dimensional surcharges from the carriers when the package size is what you pay for rather than just the weight.") ?></p>
