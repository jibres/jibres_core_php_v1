👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

You are free but if you're accept below rules it's not bad! dont worry:)



## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.


Thanks,
Javad Evazzadeh Kakroudi, Ermile ❤️
